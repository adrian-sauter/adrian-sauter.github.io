Hey, I'm Adrian.  
I'm a first-year MSc student in Artificial Intelligence at the [University of Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/en). I am broadly interested in the `interpretability, safety, and alignment of AI` and believe that these topics are crucial for developing trustworthy and beneficial AI systems.  
Before my MSc, I graduated with a BSc in [Cognitive Science at the University of Tübingen](https://uni-tuebingen.de/en/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/studium/studiengaenge/kognitionswissenschaft/informationen-zu-den-studiengaengen/bachelor/), where I expored the intersection of human cognition and intelligent systems. My bachelor thesis, titled "Video Background Extraction with a Masked-Autoencoder-Based Neural Network", supervised by [Prof. Martin Butz](https://uni-tuebingen.de/fakultaeten/mathematisch-naturwissenschaftliche-fakultaet/fachbereiche/informatik/lehrstuehle/cognitive-modeling/staff/martin-butz/) and [Dr. Manuel Traub](https://manuel-traub.de/), was built on top of the [LOCI-project](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13349) and was part of a [publication](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10410) at [ICANN 2024](https://e-nns.org/icann2024/).  
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss AI, cognitive science, or any exciting interdisciplinary projects. I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations!
